## Recipe Management System

The Recipe Management System project allows users to organize and manage their recipes effectively. It is implemented in Python and utilizes object-oriented programming principles to create classes for recipes, ingredients, and the recipe management system itself.

### Project Structure

```
recipe_management_system/
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── recipe.py
│   ├── ingredient.py
│   └── README.md

```

- `main.py`: Contains the main Python script for the Recipe Management System.
- `recipe.py`: Contains the class definitions for recipes.
- `ingredient.py`: Contains the class definitions for ingredients.
- `README.md`: Documentation file explaining the project.

### Implementation Details

- The `Ingredient` class represents individual ingredients. It includes attributes such as name, quantity, and unit.
- The `Recipe` class represents recipes. It includes attributes such as title, ingredients list, and instructions.
- The `RecipeManager` class manages the collection of recipes. It allows adding new recipes, viewing existing recipes, and searching for recipes based on ingredients or titles.
- In the `main` function, a `RecipeManager` instance is created, and recipes are added to its collection.
- Users can interact with the Recipe Management System by adding, viewing, and searching for recipes.

This Recipe Management System provides a user-friendly interface for organizing and accessing recipes efficiently. Users can easily add new recipes, view existing ones, and search for recipes based on ingredients or titles.
